This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable and immutable references.  The `bug.rs` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.rs` offers a corrected version.  This error typically occurs when a programmer misunderstands the difference between `&mut` (mutable reference) and `&` (immutable reference).  It's crucial to use mutable references (`&mut`) only when you intend to modify the value.
